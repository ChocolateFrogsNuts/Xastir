# TODO:
# Run commands such as these:
#   cd /usr/local/share/xastir; testdbfawk -D config -d Counties/mz11au16.dbf 2>&1 | less
#   cd /usr/local/share/xastir; testdbfawk -D config -d Counties/w_11au16.dbf 2>&1 | less
# to determine whether there's dbfawk support for each of the NWS files. NWS changes the signature
# on their files often, so we need to create a new dbfawk for each in xastir/config, test it, then
# add it into the Makefile.am file there and commit, then do another "make install" to put the
# dbfawk's into place.
